# 🎮 ISO'S GAME BROWSERS HUB (PS5 Style)

This repository serves as a centralized hub for various standalone JavaScript/HTML browser games, unified under a modern, dynamic interface inspired by the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Dashboard.

This project streamlines individual game repositories into a single, cohesive user experience, allowing users to browse and launch different games from one central menu.

✨ Features

PS5-Inspired Interface: A dark, dynamic UI designed to mimic the console's look and feel.

Centralized Game Access: All games (e.g., XOX-Game, Neon-Brain-Pong) are integrated and launched from the hub.

Dynamic Backgrounds: The main background image changes instantly based on the currently focused game card.

Perfect Centering: The selected game card is always displayed in the exact center of the screen, regardless of its scale.

Intuitive Navigation: Seamless navigation using keyboard inputs (Arrow Keys and Enter/Space).

The JavaScript handles the rest, automatically including the new card in the navigation and focusing logic.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3 (with dynamic vw/vh units for responsiveness)

Tailwind CSS (via CDN)

Vanilla JavaScript (for navigation and dynamic scaling calculations)
